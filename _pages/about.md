I'm an IT geek with a profound connection to the Silesian University of Technology, driven by the dream of contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of technology.  
My motto has always been:  

> If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0

## My interests
As a current PhD student, my academic journey revolves around the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence, in which I am constantly growing. This exploration not only deepens my understanding of machine learning and deep learning, but also broadens my insights into various scientific fields, contributing to a holistic comprehension of the world around me.

## Website aim
In many cases, the internet has provided a solution to challenges I have faced in my life. For me, this website is an expression of gratitude, a space where I can delve into more detailed descriptions of the programmes I create, and offer a potential helping hand to people struggling with the issues I discuss.
