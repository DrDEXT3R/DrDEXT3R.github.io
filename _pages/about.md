I'm a normal guy with a great dream of doing something useful for society. 

## What is my function in life?
I study at the Silesian University of Technology. In my free time I like to do things related to the IT industry.

## Why blog?
In many cases, the Internet has allowed me to solve the problems I have encountered in my life. For me, this blog is to be an expression of gratitude, a place where I will be able to describe in more detail the programs that I create and be a potential helping hand drawn towards people facing problem which I am describing.
