## Description
Eye Tracker is a program for tracking and marking irises on webcam images. Due to the possibility of adjusting the threshold value in the settings window, the application works correctly in different lighting conditions. All tests were carried out on an average webcam (0.3 MP) embedded in a laptop computer.
